    "## Problem 1\n",
    "We're going to briefly look at truth tables. As an example let's assume we have a 100 photos, some of birds and some of people. In a truth table you assume you can categorize the true answerâ€”let's say you pay an undergraduate to sort the photos into birds and people. Then you want to have an automated sorting algorithm. However that works, whether it is by looking a the color at the center of photo or using a neural network (NN), it will also sort the photos but imperfectly. Given two sorts you can then arrange a truth table:\n",
    "\n",
    "|           | True Bird | True Person |\n",
    "|-----------|-----------|-------------|\n",
    "| NN Bird   | 45        | 5           |\n",
    "| NN Person | 3         | 47          |\n",
    "\n",
    "There are 48 birds and 52 People (columns), and there are 8 miscategorizations. The NN called three of the birds people, and 5 of the people birds.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is useful because it not only shows the number of errors, but the type, and not all errors are created equal. Let's say our identification system is being used to keep birds from escaping the aviary at the zoo by locking the aviary door when a bird is trying to escape. We really don't want to let birds escape, but locking a person in for 30 extra seconds is not a big deal. In this case false bird identification is not so bad, but false person identification lets a bird escape.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's say the above truth table is the current system, and you've developed a new algorithm (NA) with the following truth table:\n",
    "\n",
    "|           | True Bird | True Person |\n",
    "|-----------|-----------|-------------|\n",
    "| NA Bird   | 47        | 11          |\n",
    "| NA Person | 1         | 41          |\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1a) Which algorithm makes the fewest mistakes?\n",
    "*Answer* : NN makes fewer mistakes, if we are just summing them. NN made 8 total mistakes, while NA made 12.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1b) Which algorithm is better for the zoo? Explain.\n",
    "*Answer*: NA is better, because less of its mistakes miscategorized birds as people, meaning less birds would get away. The people can be held up at a lesser cost than the birds flying away.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1c) During the pandemic the number of visitors plummets, and it is only the zoo keeper visiting. So instead of 52% of the photos taken at the aviary door being people, it is now only 1%. Make new truth tables for both algorithms.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Answer*:\n",
    "\n",
    "|           | True Bird | True Person |\n",
    "|-----------|-----------|-------------|\n",
    "| NA Bird   |           |             |\n",
    "| NA Person |           |             |\n",
    "\n",

    "|           | True Bird | True Person |\n",

Looking up the gamma distribution we see that a gamma with N=1 is an exponential distribution, and just to check we can see that the sqrt of an exponential distribution is a Rayleigh distribution to bring us full circle.\n",
